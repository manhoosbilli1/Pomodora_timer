## Project Description

The Pomodora Timer is a simple yet effective tool to help you manage your time using the Pomodoro Technique. It features a physical timer with LED indicators and a buzzer to signal the start and end of focus and break periods. The timer is built using an Arduino Uno, NeoPixel LEDs, a button, and a buzzer. The project includes the following features:

- **Focus Mode**: The timer starts in focus mode, indicated by a red LED. The focus period lasts for a configurable amount of time.
- **Break Mode**: After the focus period, the timer switches to break mode, indicated by a green LED. The break period also lasts for a configurable amount of time.
- **Buzzer Alerts**: The buzzer provides audible alerts at the start and end of each focus and break period.
- **Button Control**: A button is used to start the timer and switch between focus and break modes.
